## Who We Are

Potential Labs is a small startup nestled in the hills of Southeast Ohio, part of the Appalachian region. We strive to build solutions that help today’s consumers track their use of resources with the goal of reducing waste. Reducing waste saves money and has a positive effect on our environment.

### Glow

Glow is a smart energy tracker for the home. It gives users real-time feedback about their energy use leading to energy savings and reduced impact on the environment. Glow’s breakthrough inductive wireless sensor allows anyone to install it in just a few minutes. The device will also alert users about extended high usage that could be dangerous, and provide simple on-the-go energy monitoring and smart budgeting tools from the companion mobile app.

### Features

- Glowing indicator of real-time energy use
- Mobile push notifications alert users of high usage
- Simple energy cost forecast and smart budgeting
- Mobile app for detailed data
- Ambient light sensor dynamically adjusts indicator brightness
- Snooze button for temporarily pausing glowing indicator

### Why Glow Matters

Over the past 15 years, the price of energy has consistently outpaced inflation. Meanwhile, America’s residential homes, on average, waste almost 40% of the energy that their occupants pay for. These factors translate into energy costs for mainstream consumers that more than two thirds (68%) say feel is exorbitant.

Additionally, in light of America pulling out of the Paris Agreement, it is more important than ever for individuals to make personal efforts to reduce their impact on the environment. Reduced energy use directly correlates to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from energy production.

Glow is an easy first step that consumers can take towards combating waste, high cost, and the environmental impact of energy production.

### Quote

> “What we came to realize, is that being in the home is just as important as tracking data about it. Glow becomes part of your life, not just another app.” — Ben Lachman, Co-founder

### Company facts

Founded in 2014 with the goal of developing an energy monitoring solution for mainstream Americans that was safe to install and easy to use.
Potential Labs is located in Athens Ohio, a college town and small hub for green tech in Ohio. Athens is home to Stirling engine and cryocooler research along with two of Ohio’s oldest solar installers.
Potential Labs plans to manufacture Glow in the USA with a focus on keeping manufacturing partners as local as possible. Their goal is to bring the maximum positive effect to their economically depressed region of Appalachian Ohio.
Glow aims to integrate with other smart home devices such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, Nest, and others.
